# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

A **Content-Based Movie Recommendation System** that suggests movies based on similarity of content such as genres and descriptions. This project is built as a **Machine Learning / Data Science portfolio** and includes an interactive **Streamlit web application**.

---

## 🚀 Application Overview

The web application allows users to:

* Select a movie they like
* Receive **Top 5 similar movie recommendations**
* View movie posters fetched in real-time from the **TMDB API**

---

## 🧠 Methodology

* **Content-Based Filtering**
* **TF-IDF Vectorization** for text representation
* **Cosine Similarity** to measure movie similarity

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* Python
* Pandas & NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Streamlit
* TMDB API
